Building
========
To create a debug apk, run `./gradlew assembleDebug`. Alternatively, you can use
`.gradlew thinDebug` for a faster compile, but this requires Scala libraries installed
with [Android-Scala-Installer](https://github.com/Arneball/Android-Scala-Installer) on your device.

To create a release apk, run `./gradlew assembleRelease`.
